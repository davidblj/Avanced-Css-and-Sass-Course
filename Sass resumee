   How CSS works (css workflow.png)

      load html
      parse html (decode and create our DOM)  
      load CSS (
         Resolve conflicting css values (creating something called the cascade)
         compute final units (e.g. % to px)
      )
      store the CSS Object model / CSSOM (tree like structure)
      The CSSOM and the DOM, forms the 'Render tree'
      website render (through an algorithm called the visual formatting model)
      final rendering (?)

   Cascade and specificity (conflict resolution.png)

      The cascade is the resulting stylesheet of resolved conflicts for
      elements that apply more than one stylesheet (the styles comes from
      the author, the user/modified browser styles and the user agent/browser).   

         1. They are resolved by their level of importance

            user !important
            author !important
            user declarations
            author declarations
            user agent declarations

         2. specificity (only if the applied rules have the same importance)
			
            (inline styles, id, classes/pseudo-classes/attributes, elements/pseudo-elements)
            
            	e.g 
            	
					( ... , [class]#id-name , .class :pseudo-class, element)
				
			The specificty is read from left to right, whover is higher in the chain,
			its going to hold its place as the final applied class
			
			This calculation is performed on every CSS declarations that falls into that element. 								

         3. source order (only if the applied rules have the same specificity)
         
         	The final declaration its going to be used

		Note:
		
			the universal selector do not have an specificity value
						
	
	Value processing (value processing.png)
	
		any value goes through a 5 stage process down into its final value.	

			- All units are processed in stage 4 ; a % is not a unit and hence not computed on this stage.
			
			- Stage 1 and 2 is skipped if there is no declared value.
		
	Cascading and specificity example (specifity example.png)						
				
	Guide of Relative units to Absolute units (units.png)	

		% is computed to its parent font size		
		
	
		em (as a font value) is relative to its parent font size value		
		
		rem (as a font value) is relative to its root font size value
		
		
		em (as a length value) is relative to the current element font size
		
		rem (as a length value) is relative to its root font size (!)
		

	How does inheritance works (inheritance.png)	
	
		knowing before hand that all properties must have a value:
		
			cascaded values are of higher priority than inherited values (declared values stop inheritance)
		
			if there is no cascaded values, and if the property is indeed an inheritable property
			then, that value property is inherited
			
			unheritable properties default to its initial value (e.g. 0px for paddings and margins)
		
		
		- text related properties are usually inherited
		- computed values are inherited, and not declared values (e.g. computed value of percentages)		
		
		- the 'inheritance' keyword, forces the inheritance
		- the 'initial' keyword resets a property to its initial value
		
	Box sizing (box model height and width.png)
	
		by setting this property to border-box, the width or height is going to include not just the content,
		but also the padding area. 
		
	Box types (box types.png)
	
		There are 3 types of box types
		
			block
				100% of parents width
				Box model applies normally
							
			inline block
				Occupies only content space
				No line breaks
				Box model applies normally
				
			inline
				Occupies only contents space
				No line breaks
				Box model has no height or width
				paddings and margins only apply to horizontal values

	Positioning scheme (positioning scheme.png)
		
		notes : floats shift all inline elements and text
				Parent wont adjust its height to floated elements
